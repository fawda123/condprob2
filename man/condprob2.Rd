\title{Conditional probability analysis in R}
\description{
This package provides a series of functions for running a conditional 
probability analysis.  This method was originally developed as a way to 
examine probability of impairment of an ecological resource (e.g. streams 
or lakes) given a stressor amount. The primary purpose of this package is to
serve as a replacement to the deprecated software described in (Hollister et
al. 2008).
